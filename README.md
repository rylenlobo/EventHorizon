The event registration system is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline college event management. It simplifies the processes of browsing, registering, obtaining e-passes, and tracking attendance for various events. Key features include:

1. **Event Information:** Provides details on event dates, times, venues, and ticket availability to keep students informed.
2. **Faculty and Organizer Tools:** Enables easy addition of new events, viewing past events, and real-time attendee counts.
3. **Pass Management:** Utilizes a YOLOv8 machine learning model for object detection and image segmentation to extract data from ID cards, preventing pass falsification.
4. **Technology Stack:** Combines ReactJS for the frontend, NodeJS for the backend, CapacitorJS for the native Android app, Firebase for authentication and database, and Python with YOLOv8 for data extraction.

This system enhances the efficiency of event management and aims to boost user engagement and satisfaction through advanced technological solutions.



EventHorizon employs a unique registration system where users scan their ID cards to register, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information from an authentic source. This is done using YOLOv8, trained specifically on St. Francis Institute of Technology ID cards.
